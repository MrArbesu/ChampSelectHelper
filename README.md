Background application that connects to the LoL client and listens for ChampSelect events. When a champion is selected, a predetermined user defined customization will be applied, depending on the champion selected. The champion customization can be changed in a GUI window.

The application doesn't need to be updated everytime there is a new patch. Everytime the GUI is opened, it retrieves the information from official or community-made sources that update every patch.
